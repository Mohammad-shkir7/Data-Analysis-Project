Power Bi Project:
In this project, I was given a movie rental store dataset, and I was asked to create a "Main Dashboard" and a "Film dashboard".
According to the following criteria: i- Easy to use ii- interactive and well designed iii- link both of the dashboards.
* Data transformation, KPIs, and more are all logged in detail in the PowerBi_Summary.pdf file. 


Python&Visualization_Project:
A more sophisticated project where I had to process a large dataset of songs with DBT(and SQL), Python, and Power BI to create a "Sales Dashboard" and "Playlist Dashboard". The main challenge in this project is using the right tool in the right way and crafting the dashboards efficiently.
